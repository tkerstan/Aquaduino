Before flashing the Aquaduino binary to your Arduino you need to setup a
SD card containing the HTML Templates for the Webinterface and allowing
for storing the configuration of the system. This packages comes shipped
with a pre configuration. Format your SD card using FAT32 and copy
the .htm files and the folder CONFIG to it and put into the SD slot of
the Arduino Ethernet Shield.

To flash the Aquaduino binary to your Arduino MEGA 2560 you need to invoke
avrdude on the command line in this directoy. Make sure avrdude for Arduino
(or avrdude.exe is in your PATH). Use the avrdude.conf file shipped with
this package and choose your serial port. Under windows you may need to
type \\.\COMx where x is your serial port number. Under linux your
Arduino is probably attached /dev/ttyACMx where x is your serial port
number.

avrdude -Cavrdude.conf -patmega2560 -cwiring -PSERIALPORT -b115200 -D \
-Uflash:w:Aquaduino.hex:i

The Aquaduino Webinterface should now be accessible using the IP address
192.168.1.222 in your favorite browser.

To verify the installation you can attach a terminal program with a
speed of 115200 baud to the serial line of your Arduino.

The output should look like this:
