What is Aquaduino?
------------------

Aquaduino is an extensible open source control system framework for fish tanks
or other related environments. Aquaduino is published under the GPLv3 and is
written in C++. It is currently developed on a DFRduino Mega 2560 with DFRduino
Ethernet Shield. It currently supports the control of digital outputs to
control my relay modules, temperature readings by using a Dallas DS18S20,
automatic refill by using a level sensor with closing contact and a simple
webinterface to manage the control of the power outlets. The strength of
Aquaduino is its extensibility which allows developers to simply support
further sensors, actors or controllers related to their special needs.

The framework provided by Aquaduino uses Webduino. To provide a seamless
integration of actuators like relays into controlling elements the Aquaduino
webinterface automatically generates a configuration webinterface to assign
the available actuators to the controlling elements of Aquaduino. Thus the
actuators can easily be enabled, disabled or assigned at runtime to the
different control elements.

Features
--------

* Network and Webinterface
    * Static or DHCP IP configuration
    * NTP synchronization
    * Configuration of actuators and controllers

* Actuator/Controller/Sensor Framework
    * Controllers are software components that control assigned actuators
    * Actuators can dynamically be assigned to controllers
    * Sensor readings are periodically triggered by the framework
    * Controllers can select the sensor providing the sensor values
    * Controllers, actuators and sensors provide their own Webinterface
    * Easily extensible to support different controllers, actuators and sensors
    * Currently supported Controllers:
        * Temperature controller
            * Three step controller algorithm with hysteresis
        * Level controller
            * Time based debounce mechanism to ignore waves
            * Time out mechanism to prevent refill pump from running dry
            * On-Off Controller algorithm with configurably hysteresis.
        * Clocktimer controller
            * Configurable amount of clocktimers
            * Configurable amount of time intervals per clocktimer
    * Currently supported Actuators
        * Digital outputs (including PWM)
    * Currently supported Sensors
        * Level sensor (Digital Input)
        * Temperature sensor (DS18x20)
        * pH/ORP/EC in progress
        * Support for monitoring using Xively

* Template Parser Framework
    * Easy integration of HTML templates in controller webinterface code
    * Completely stack based (No dynamic memory consumption)
    * Templates stored on SD Card (No static memory consumption)

* Configuration Management
    * Support for SD Card storage to store system configuration

Hardware Setup
--------------

Aquaduino runs on the Arduino Mega 2560 and requires an Ethernetshield.
